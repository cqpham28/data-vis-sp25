# **ðŸ“ŒProposal **


## Dataset
We use **"International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) Data** - a publicly available dataset from [tidytuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) to conduct analysis. 

- Published: 2024-09-24
- Github description: [link](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2024/2024-09-24/readme.md)
- At a glance, there are  three key data files:
    - `country_results_df.csv`: Aggregated country-level performance data, including team size and medal counts.
    - `individual_results_df.csv`: Individual contestant performance and awards.
    - `timeline_df.csv`: Historical timeline of IMO events, including host countries and participant demographics.


## Proposed Questions
1. How have country rankings at IMO shifted over time, and to what extent do variations/patterns in some internal variables (e.g., team size, proportion of 1st-time participants & veterans, gender distribution) influence a country's performance?

2. How do external environmental factors, such as on-site weather conditions (e.g., temperature and humidity), influence individual performance outcomes, and do these effects vary across participants from different geographical regions?"
